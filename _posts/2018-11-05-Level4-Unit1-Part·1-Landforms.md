* Mountains are landforms higher than 2000 feet, or about 600 meters,above sea level.
* `Hills are like mountains, but not as tall.`
* Mountains are formed by forces deep within the Earth and are made of many types of rocks.
* Rivers are streams of water that usually begin in mountains and flow into the sea.
* `Many early cities were built alongside rivers.`
* Most of the world's water is in the oceans,which are large bodies of salt water.
* `The oceans are also an important source of oxygen.`
* Deserts are areas of land that receive little or no rainfall.
* The amount of rainfall in some deserts is so low that only a few plants can survive.
* A valley is a low,relatively flat area between hills or mountains, often with a river running through it.
* Some valleys are formed by flowing water, and others are formed by glaciers.
