### PartI
Christina arrived two days ago, the day before yesterday.
Her friend met her at the airport and drove her to her apartment.
Her apartment is just north of the airport,about 20 minutes from San Francisco.
It's a small apartment,but it's on a hill and has a great view.
Yesterday,they went downtown and rode the cable cars.
Christina was surprised by how steep the hills are.
Then they walked along the ocean and ate lunch at a seafood restaurant.
From the restaurant, they could see the Golden Gate Bridge.

### PartII
Tomorrow they're planning to drive to Yosemite National Park.
By car it's about 4 hours away.
Chritina has never been there before, so she is excited.
She has heard that the park is very beautiful.
Her friend has been to Yosemite several times.
She says it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
Christina just hopes that her friend is good driver.
