She has two employees now and her company is slowly growing.

`Her husband didn't come because he has to work.`

Once he saves enough money, he plans to start another company.
He doesn't want to give up.

### Part IV

`The first time was when she was a high school student.`
That was more than 10 years ago.
During that trip she was only in San Francisco for a few days.

This time she and her friends plan to relax and have fun.
